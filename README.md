# Space Strangers

A computer games project for the **NASA Hackathon**, Athlone 2024. This is a _virtual reality_ video game set in a space environment of which you have to guide yourself around to different planets. On each planet is a little plant you must water to help it grow.

The Hackathon challenge my team and I took on was **'Galactic Games: Fun in a Microgravity Environment!'** in which we had to design and develop a game that _"leverages the unique challenges and opportunities of a microgravity envioronment to entertain and contribute to the overall well-being and cohesion of astronaut crews, enchancing their resilience and adapatbility in the extraterrestrail frontier."_

The six of us brainstormed ideas on how we could keep astronuats mentally stimulated, and we developed the idea to allow the astronauts to care for their own plants on planets close to them. As astronauts are kept in a grey box, surrounded by machinery, we thought it would be beneficial for them to see a little greenery and have the objective of caring for these plants when they're not working.

This game is only a prototype, and could be developed furthur to be of more value to the astronauts using it. The team developed many more ideas for the project, but with the resources and time we had, this prototype is all we could get done.

This game requires an Oculus Quest VR Headset (tested on Quest 2) with the supporting Meta Quest Link Software installed, a reliable quest link connection between a Windows PC and the headset, and requires OpenXR Runtime enabled in the Meta Quest Link app at Setttings > General.
